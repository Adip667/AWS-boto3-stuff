Few boto3 scripts i wrote when teaching myself python

sgReport.py - scan AWS for list of Security groups and creates a CSV report with list of inbound ports

cleanResources.py - scan AWS for EC2, EBS, AMI, Snapshop and SG, then it check for tag 'keep' for some of the resource, delete the resources and creates xlsx report
